ghost aims to provide a secret-store with a single, simple-to-use API supporting multiple storage backends without requiring a server to run.

## Alternatives

* While [Vault](http://vaultproject.io) is truly spectacular and I've been using it for quite a while now, it requires a server running.
* [Credstash](https://github.com/fugue/credstash) is only AWS KMS based. 
* [Unicreds](https://github.com/Versent/unicreds) is based on credstash and, again, only supports KMS.
* [Sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) is complicated to use and also is KMS based. 
* There's a new project called [sstash](https://github.com/realcr/sstash), but it only supports file based encryption and is not intuitive enough as I see it. 
* Google developed something called [Keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar), but it doesn't seem to be under development.
* [Keywhiz](https://github.com/square/keywhiz), like vault, also requires a server.. and let's face it, I ain't gonna run Java on my laptop just for that thank you.


## Installation

```shell
pip install ghost
```

For dev:

```shell
pip install https://github.com/nir0s/ghost/archive/master.tar.gz
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
$ ghost
Usage: ghost [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Ghost generates a secret-store in which you can keep your secrets
  encrypted. Ghost isn't real. It's just in your head.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  delete  Delete a key from the stash
  export  Export all keys to a file
  get     Retrieve a key from the stash
  init    Init a stash
  list    List all keys in the stash
  load    Loads all keys from an exported key file to...
  purge   Purge the stash from all of its keys
  put     Insert a key to the stash


# Initializing a stash
$ ghost init

```

NOTE: `--passphrase` and `--stash` can be supplied via the `GHOST_STASH_PATH` and `GHOST_PASSPHRASE` env vars.

NOTE: The default backend for the CLI is TinyDB. If you want to use the SQLAlchemy backend, you must either provide the `--stash` and `--backend` flags with every command or set the `--GHOST_STASH_PATH` and `--GHOST_BACKEND` env vars after having initialized the stash. Not providing the stash path and the backend will make ghost fail misrebly.

### Directly from Python

```python
import ghost

# Initialize a new stash
storage = TinyDBStorage(db_path='~/.local/share/ghost/stash.json')
# Can also generate a passphrase via `ghost.generate_passphrase(passphrase_size=20)`
stash = Stash(storage, passphrase='P!3pimp5i31')
stash.init()

# Insert a key
stash.put(key='aws', value={'secret': 'my_secret', access: 'my_access'})
# Get the key
key = stash.get(key='aws')
print(key)
...

# List all keys in a stash
stash.list()

# Delete a key
stash.delete('aws')
```

## Backends

Currently, only two backends are provided.

* [TinyDB](http://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) (Tested on v1.0.15) (Note that the SQLAlchemyStorage supports any SQLAlchemy connection string. The default one is sqlite)

NOTE: ghost doesn't install SQLAlchemy by default or any other backend other than TinyDB for that matter. Please Install SQLAlchemy separately if you need to use its backend.

I'd like to also support Vault in addition to KMS and any other cloud provider based key stores.


## Encryption & Decryption

Encryption is done using [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/). It is done only on values and these are saved in hexa. Keys are left in plain text.

Values are encrypted once provided and decrypted only upon request, meaning that they're only available in memory for a very short period of time.

See [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)'s documentation for additional information.


## Exporting and Importing

You can export and import all keys in a stash using the `ghost export` and `ghost load` commands (same methods in the Python API).

The `export` command allows you to generate a json file containing all keys (encrypted, of course) while the `load` command can then load that file into another stash using the same, or a different storage backend. 

So, for instance, if you have a local implementation using sqlite, you could export all keys; create a new stash using the SQLAlchemy storage for postgre and load all keys into that storage for your server's implementation.

This also enables you to create a backup flow for your keys.


## Secret key delegation

Since ghost doesn't run as a server, it doesn't provide a formal method for delegating keys to a server without explicitly passing them over in plain text post-decryption. You can work around that by retrieving a key without decrypting it (via the `--no-decrypt` flag in the CLI or the `decrypt` argument in the Python API) and sending it to the other server where the same passphrase is held and decrypting  it there.

This can be done somewhat like this:

```python
...
encrypted_value = stash.get('my_key', decrypt=False)['value']
save_to_file(encrypted_value)

# and on the server
...
stash = Stash(storage, passphrase='SAME_PASSPHRASE')
decrypted_value = stash._decrypt(encrypted_value_from_file)
```

## Testing

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nir0s/ghost.git
cd ghost
pip install tox
tox
```
