**0.4.1 (2016-10-11)
* Fix any remaining Windows related issues and fix the tests. Windows support is now official.

**0.4.0 (2016-10-11)
* Add a Vault backend
* Add an Elasticsearch backend
* Add a Consul backend (Thanks tehasdf!)
* Add `migrate` command and API which performs a comfortable `export` and `load` from one stash to another.
* Add contribution docs, backend specific docs and more elaborate docs in general.
* Add `extras_require` for the different backends so that you can now run `pip install ghost[backend_name]` to install the backend's dependencies.
* Verify Windows support. Ghost currently supports Windows, there are some tests to fix though.
* Provide a default stash path in the CLI for each backend type.
* Use appdirs to provide the default dir for ghost's home (Thanks jcollado!)
* Fix not being able to `stash.get(key)` twice using the API.
* Fix not being able to create a stash in the `cwd` when using a file based backend like TinyDB or SQLite

**0.3.0 (2016-09-25)**

* Generated passphrase will now be printed to a file (`cwd/passphrase.ghost`) instead of to the screen.
* Add 99% test coverage.
* Support Python 3.
* Remove logger in favor of `click`'s `echo`.
* Allow to choose backend using the CLI.
* Add `export` and `load` CLI commands and APIs to allow to export all keys in a stash to a file and then load them, potentially to a stash of a different backend.
* Add `purge` API and CLI command to delete all keys in a stash.
* Replace `--value` options with unlimited arguments in the form of `key=value` for the `value` field of a key.
* Add `--no-decrypt` flag to the CLI when running `ghost get`.
* Use SQLAlchemy PickleType for values in the SQLAlchemy Storage.
* Add `-j` flag to jsonify key list.
* Remove `T` from the timestamp in the `modified_at` and `created_at` fields of a key.

**0.2.0 (2016-09-18)**

* Replace simple-crypt with cryptography for a faster and more common encryption engine.
* Replace the current inheritence implementation with a composition implementation which easily allow to implement additional backends.
* Fix a bug where a stash couldn't be initialized.
* When using the Python API, verify that the `value` field is always a dict.
* Allow to retrieve a value via `stash.get_value(key=key)`
* Raise an error if a stash is initialized twice in the same path
* Change the `--val` flag to `--value`. `--val` is just weird.

**0.1.4 (2016-09-15)**

* First release of ghost
* Support both TinyDB and SQLAlchemy as supported backends.
* Allow to put, modify, get, delete and list keys.
* Provide encryption via simple-crypt.
* Each key contains the following fields: `description`, `name`, `value`, `created_at`, `modified_at`, `uid` and `metadata`.
* Provide a click based CLI using the TinyDB backend (for now, you can't choose the backend to use when using the CLI. This will be changed later on.)
* When using the CLI, allow to both pretty print and JSON print when retrieving a key.
* Allow to get a
